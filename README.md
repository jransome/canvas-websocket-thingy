# Canvas WebSocket Thingy

A tiny web application that allows collaborative drawing via websockets on a canvas in the browser.

To run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in two different browser tabs. Click to draw on the canvas - what you draw will instantly appear on the other browser tab!
